# Rock, Paper Scissor Game.

The perfect Rock, Paper, Scissor Lizard Spock Game is a fun and interactive game, it's perfect for playing with friends, family, and even yourself! When playing with people you hold dear and have spent a lot of time getting to know, the odds of knowing your next move becomes higher. That is why we have the function of playing against the computer! The computer selects a random option making a win, much more difficult! 

The user of the game will learn how the game works once he opens up the website and hovers over the rules header, and how to explain it to others! The perfect Rock, Paper Scissor Lizard Spock Game is targeted at children and adults!
